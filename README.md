# FinalProject_Radio

## Description:

This is the final project radio that uses bluetooth, and SD card, LCD display, and a speaker to act as a radio/iPod device. The goal of this project was to have users use a GUI on their device to select from the pre-made list of songs to play out of the speaker. The songs were downloaded .WAV files that we uploaded to the SD card. The users phones were connected to the arduino via bluetooth. Overall, our project served its main purpose but had many flaws.

## Needed software

The main file needed to get your arduino to work is named speaker_working bluetooth. This is the only file in the lists that you need to run the script with the songs that are uploaded onto the repository. The .WAV songs can be taken from this and uploaded onto an SD card that extracted into FAT 32 mode. These files and the script are the only things needed to run our project.
